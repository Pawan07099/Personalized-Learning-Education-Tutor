# PERSONALIZED LEARNING REMEDIATION / EDUCATION TUTOR

## Description üìù  
A comprehensive AI-driven system that helps educators optimize teaching methodologies by suggesting personalized pedagogical and andragogical approaches based on subject matter, student needs, and historical success data. The system leverages Natural Language Processing and Generative AI to provide data-driven teaching recommendations and implementation strategies.

---

## Key Features  
- AI-powered pedagogy and andragogy recommendations  
- Real-time adaptation to student needs  
- Data-driven methodology suggestions  
- Integration with advanced AI (Gemini API) for methodology generation  
- User-friendly interface for educators  
- Continuous improvement through feedback loops  
- Historical performance analysis  
- Personalized learning plan generation  
- Multi-subject support  
- ICT tool recommendations  

---

## Motivation üéØ  
Traditional teaching approaches often use uniform pedagogical methods across diverse learners, expecting similar results despite varying learning abilities. This project addresses key challenges such as:  
- Limited personalization in current teaching methods  
- Difficulty adapting strategies to individual learners  
- Lack of data-driven decision making in education  
- Need for systematic teaching improvements  
- Bridging the gap between theory and practice in pedagogy

## Installation Steps ü™ú  

### Backend Setup  

### Environment Variables Setup  
Before running the servers, create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret (for Node.js authentication)
JWT_SECRET=a_very_long_random_secret_key_for_jwt_signing

# Groq API Key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# Pinecone API Key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
# PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment # Only needed for pod-based indexes, e.g., 'gcp-starter'

# Google Client ID (for any Google OAuth integration)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```

Open **three separate terminals** and run the following commands:

1. **Terminal 1:** Start the Node.js server  
```bash
cd backend  
node server.js  
```

2. **Terminal 2:** Run the Node.js application (if separate)  
```bash
cd backend  
npm run start  
```

3. **Terminal 3:** Run the Python backend service  
```bash
cd backend/python_service  # adjust path if needed  
python app.py  
```

### Frontend Setup  
In a **new terminal**, run:  
```bash
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm run dev  
```
