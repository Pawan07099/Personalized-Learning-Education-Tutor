# Pedagogy and Andragogy Suggestion System Using RAG Model & Generative AI

## Description üìù

A comprehensive AI-driven system that helps educators optimize teaching methodologies by suggesting personalized pedagogical and andragogical approaches based on subject matter, student needs, and historical success data. The system leverages Natural Language Processing and Generative AI to provide data-driven teaching recommendations and implementation strategies.

### Key Features

- AI-powered pedagogy and andragogy recommendations
- Real-time adaptation to student needs
- Data-driven methodology suggestions
- Integration with advanced AI (Gemini API) for methodology generation
- User-friendly interface for educators
- Continuous improvement through feedback loops
- Historical performance analysis
- Personalized learning plan generation
- Multi-subject support
- ICT tool recommendations

## Motivation üéØ

Traditional teaching approaches often use uniform pedagogical methods across diverse learners, expecting similar results despite varying learning abilities. This project addresses several key challenges:

- Limited personalization in current teaching methods
- Difficulty in adapting teaching strategies to individual learners
- Lack of data-driven decision making in educational approaches
- Need for systematic improvement in teaching effectiveness
- Gap between pedagogical theory and practical implementation
